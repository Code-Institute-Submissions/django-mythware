## Deployment
The following section describes the process to deploy this project to Heroku.

1. Ensure all required technologies are installed locally, as per the `requirements.txt`file.
2. Via Linux Terminal, login to Heroku, using 'heroku login' command. Input Heroku login details.
3. Create new Heroku app, using 'heroku apps:create appname' command.

Go to Resources to add a DB > type Postgres and choose Heroku Postgres > Hobby - Free
sudo pip3 install dj-database-url - this is a package that allows us to connect to a DB url
sudo pip3 install psycopg2 - this is a package for connecting to postgres databases
Copy Postrgres URL from Heroku, under Settings - Reveal Config Vars. Update env.py > paste in Heroku postgres url
python3 manage.py makemigrations - no changes detected. python3 manage.py migrate
As this is a new empty DB, we need to create a new superusr. ython3 manage.py createsuperuser
The sqlite db that we had, was just for testing, you are now going to have to now rebuild all the products. NOTE: PRIOR PRODUCTS ADDED WILL DISAPPEAR AT THIS STAGE.
Serve your static files from Amazon AWS cloud server, that you can take a bit of space from - log into Amazon
We'll have to update our code to use S3. sudo pip3 install django-storages - package that allows us to connect django to S3
sudo pip3 install boto3 - package that allows us to connect django to S3
sudo pip3 install gunicorn


4. Push project to Heroku, using 'push -u heroku master' command.
5. Create scale, using 'heroku ps:scale web=1' command.
6. Login to Heroku and select newly created app.
7. Select settings. Select ‘Reveal Config'. Add IP 0.0.0.0 and PORT 5000.
8. From 'More' menu on the top right, select 'Restart all dynos'.
9. View app: In settings, select Domain URL, NOT Git URL to view your hosted application.
10. Deployed via Heroku: [Mythware](#).
